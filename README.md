# A Multimodal Application for Vernacular Language Translation and Image Synthesis

## Problem Statement

Create a web-based application that:
1. Translates Tamil text to English.
2. Generates images from the translated text using AI.
3. Produces creative written content based on the translated text.

## Objective

Deploy pre-trained or fine-tuned models using Hugging Face or AWS, accessible via a web app built with Streamlit or Gradio.

## Skills Learned
- **Deep Learning**: Understanding neural networks and their applications in NLP and image generation.
- **Transformers**: Utilizing transformer architectures for tasks such as translation and text generation.
- **Hugging Face Models**: Implementing various models from the Hugging Face library for translation and image generation.
- **LLM (Large Language Models)**: Leveraging large-scale language models for creative content generation.
- **Streamlit or Gradio**: Developing user-friendly interfaces for machine learning applications.
- **AWS**: Deploying models and applications in a cloud environment for scalability and accessibility.
